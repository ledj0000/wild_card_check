What is a Wildcard DNS/Domain?
A wildcard DNS is a type of domain configuration where, for example, visiting example.com allows you to access "wildcard.example.com"
That specific URL will not work because it doesn't use a wildcard domain.

Why would I use this?
If you are like me, on a school or work computer it has a lot of blocked websites. You may be able to use the website for a day, but eventually it will be blocked.
If the website that was blocked has a wildcard domain, you can simply enter "Anytexthere.blocked-website.com." The placeholder "Anytexthere" can be replaced with anything.
When you use the wildcard, it has a good chance of being unblocked
